###Notes on general trends during the first Era (i.e. the Quartos Campaigne)
The player is the commander of the Home Legion, one of several armies rushed through training to send to the endangered protecterates. The player commands two other sub-commanders and recieves orders from the Home Legion as well as requests from the Coast and Plains Legions and the Biner Expedition. The orders from Home are few, however, and the player has a large amount of autonomy about how they try to save the empire. The campaigne ends once the player dies (fairly inenvitable really, as playing it safe will result in the other loss-condition) or the Imperial City is conquered.

The Tertial militants grow steadily stronger and more aggressive. The most likely Triumvirate to emerge is a Pyro/Plains/Dragoon but others are possible.
If the Pentoi survive, they slowly grow to become great warriors. However, they hate the Terti and ally with the Empire (unless the empire attacks or refuses to defend them, in which case they'll certainly die against the Terti)
The Necri will grow in power almost certainly. If no other power will help a faction, and they are desperate, most will seek necromantic help.
The Subjucates will almost all perish before the end, and the Plains Legion as well. If somehow they do survive the Plains Legion become the Exemplar Order for the rest of the game. (a Pentoi Exemplar would probably be a match for a goddamn Trygon, mebbe)
If not watched closely, the Coast Legions may either establise dictatorship over their protectorates or desert en masse and become mercenaries. If managed well, some Monou city-states may remain within the Empire
The Biner Expedition can easily be slain by the Ivories, Cnights or lost within the Maelstrom. This will leave the Empire without magic for the rest of the game. Depending on their success, different abilities become avaiable througout the 1st Era.
The Cult grows non-militarily throughout. Usually each city-state will have Cultists within it by the end
If the Isles can go without making an alliance (either because they defeat any attack easily or they are never conquered) they will remain independant. Same with the Mancers.
However the Mancers will attempt to extend their influence, with expeditions into Biner and trade/possible conquest into the city-states
Each city-state will just attempt to stay alive. They will do whatever they have to to do that.

If at any point Quartos Heartlands are invaded all legions will be immediately recalled. Once lost, control over the protecterates is more-or-less impossible to re-establish.

###Notes on changes when going into the Second Era (i.e. the Tertial campaigne)
If Pentoi are still alive, they become powerful mercenaries. You get them free if you subjugate Pentos, but it's well defended and you have to train them from scratch (and the only Pentoi with unique skills you have to kill taking Pentos)
No more Subj, they're either dead or part of the Empire now.
New Tertial Faction: Trygonal Dragoons. They quickly form a triumvirate with the player (whom picks a faction) and another faction ( a choice which the player can heavily influence).

###General trends Second Era
The player is a Triumvirate, newly-formed. They must first destroy the old Triumvirate (the main enemy during the first Era) and reunify the Tertial factions (though they don't really have to). Throughout they have to keep the Triumvirate together as well as expand their territory as much as possible. The campaigne ends if: 1. the player dies, 2. a trygon dies (any one of them, not just the player's) 3. the triumvirate collapses.
