The most powerful necromancer to ever live. Dominus seeks after his own immortality with the dual motivators of ambition and absolute terror of death. His crimes of abduction and necromantic experiments (amounting to torture in many cases) make him the enemy of most civilisation, though the less strupulous gladly deal with him for his superior mancical weaponry and alchemical knowledge. Dominus has gathered unto him a following of acolytes who wish to share in any longevity he discovers. Also hired with coin or promises are bands of sellswords and bandits whom protect Dominus' interests. This amounts to a physical force augmented with a powerful mancical cadre.
